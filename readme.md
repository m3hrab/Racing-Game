# Racing Game(Major Sjenks)
Hi, I want to make a game according to some specifics. It doesn't need to be too crazy, but I would prefer if you could make it snazy if you get my drift. 
Specifications: The game I am going to develop will be a kind of racing game where it is important to get the highest possible score. The game must contain a path where the user moves an object around. The game must be two dimensional and the perspective must be from top to bottom. There must be various objects on the screen the player must drive around or fulfill requirements such as having to press a button to reach points.
The faster the player manages to move from point to point, the more points it should be worth. The plan is for 7 different points to be created where a random out of those points other than the one the player has taken lights up so the player knows where to drive. The high score should be able to be saved together with the full name if the player so wishes. The high score must be stored in a file system external to the computer in the file type comma separated values ​​(.csv (learned to say it right now))." And also it has to fulfill these requirements: "The application must meet the following criteria:
1. The application must contain external data sets that are processed by the application
2. You must use variables and/or constants and lists/dictionaries in the code. You must use at least one multidimensional list/dictionary
3. The application must import data from and export data to external documents
or databases
4. The application must process data using both built-in and custom data
functions
5. The application must make use of object-oriented programming with the definition of
classes, objects and inheritance
6. The code must contain comments that must be included as part of the technical
the documentation of the program
7. The application must have a user interface that is adapted to the rules/conventions for
good design for the type of application you are creating
8. The application must be developed so that it will be possible to make extensions/adaptations
at any point in the development process." Can you fulfill these stringent requirement for my budget?
